# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Commitment to Security

The Claude Desktop MCP Execution project takes security seriously. As a tool that executes code, we implement multiple layers of protection to ensure safe operation while maintaining functionality. This document outlines our security practices, reporting procedures, and the measures we take to protect users.

## üîí Security Features

### Multi-Layer Sandboxing

Our execution environment employs multiple security strategies:

1. **RestrictedPython**: Compile-time restrictions on dangerous operations
2. **ASTeval**: Mathematical expression evaluation with limited scope
3. **Subprocess Isolation**: Complete process isolation with resource limits
4. **Basic Sandbox**: Minimal execution environment for simple code

### Resource Protection

- **Memory Limits**: Configurable memory restrictions (default: 256MB)
- **Execution Timeouts**: Automatic termination of long-running code (default: 10 seconds)
- **CPU Limits**: Process-level CPU usage restrictions
- **Network Isolation**: No network access in sandboxed environments

### Input Validation

- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis to detect dangerous patterns
- **Import Filtering**: Whitelist/blacklist for allowed imports
- **Pattern Detection**: Recognition of potentially malicious code structures
- **Size Limits**: Maximum code length restrictions (50KB)

### Audit and Monitoring

- **Execution Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all code executions
- **Security Events**: Special logging for security violations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Resource usage tracking
- **Error Pattern Analysis**: Detection of suspicious activity patterns

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| 0.9.x   | ‚úÖ Until 2024-12-31|
| < 0.9   | ‚ùå No              |

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### Inherent Risks

**Code Execution**: This tool executes user-provided code, which inherently carries security risks. While we implement multiple protection layers, users should:

- Never execute untrusted code from unknown sources
- Review AI-generated code before production use
- Use appropriate access controls in production environments
- Regularly update to the latest version

**Sandbox Limitations**: No sandbox is 100% secure. Advanced attackers may find ways to escape sandboxes through:

- Zero-day vulnerabilities in Python
- Exploitation of underlying system vulnerabilities
- Social engineering attacks
- Side-channel attacks

### Current Limitations

1. **Python-Only Sandboxing**: Multi-language execution may have different security profiles
2. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Third-party libraries may contain vulnerabilities
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Sophisticated attacks might find ways to exhaust system resources
4. **Information Disclosure**: Error messages might reveal system information

## üì¢ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure Process

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** email security@claude-mcp-project.org with details
3. **DO** provide a clear description and reproduction steps
4. **DO** allow reasonable time for response and fixes

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information:

- **Vulnerability Type**: Buffer overflow, injection, privilege escalation, etc.
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected
- **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability can be exploited
- **Impact Assessment**: What an attacker could achieve
- **Proof of Concept**: Safe demonstration of the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
